                polar bar chart. For the radar chart on the left I looked at what the top 7 genres of movies Depp acts
                in and saw that drama takes the lead. I then wanted to see what are the average ratings of the movies
                in those categories and made the polar bar chart on the right. By observing this chart we can see that 
                even though he mainly acts in dramas, those tend to be his lowest rated movies while his documentaries 
                are the highest rated. Each point/slice can be hovered over to give a detailed view of the counts of each movie 
                in the genres.

            <td colspan='2' id="pieGrid"><b>Analysis:</b> For the top two charts I decided to make a bubble chart and
                heatmap focusing on Depp's Filmogrophy. On the left I made a bubble chart depicting a timeline of
                different projects and showed how they rated by their filmogrophy type. The size of the bubble is 
                determined by the number of ratings the filmogrophy got. Each bubble can be hovered over to give info
                on the title of the film, the exact rating, the number of ratings, and its year created. We can see that 
                movies dominate the majority of his filmogrophy and it (and other categories) can be toggled on/off by clicking
                on the corresponding bubble on legend. On the right I created a heat map of Depp's filmogrophy over the years adn
                the numbers of ratings they received. As the map shows, the filmogrophy that Depp participated in has an
                average rating between 6.5 of 7.4. We can also see that Depp has been most active mainly since 2000 with a 
                high period between 2005 - 2009. Grids can be hovered over for more information and the right tab shows a bar
                chart of the number of films for a specific rating. (Note: A few TV series were omitted from both charts
                because they started before Depp's career)

                movies, The Pirates of the Caribbean, and see how much they grossed in various countries. Using data from 
                boxofficemojo.com, I managed to clean it and plot it on a world map. Here we can see some interesting things.
                After the second movie the series made less money in North America but more in other parts of the world like
                China and Russia. It is also interesting to note that all the movies in the series were played in China except
                for the second one. This is because the second movie was censored in China and never displayed there 
                and therefore never made any money.
